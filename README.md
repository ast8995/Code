Predicting-Critical-Temperature-of-Superconductors-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains my project on predicting critical temperature of superconductors using machine learning.
I have tried different models such as random forest, BART, CART, MARS, Artificial Neural Networks, GLM, GAM and compared the results using pairwise t-tests
I have used different feature selection methods such as PCA, Correlation, Variable Importance
Based on the results, I selected random forest and artificial neural networks
Random forest is able to beat the results produced in the earlier research conducted by Hamidieh in his research paper https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Data-Driven-Statistical-Model-for-Predicting-the-Hamidieh/b3bea0ac481f0869cb746f3b44d5689bf1a9b924
I suggest an ensemble of Random Forest and Aritificial Neural Networks
The final report titled A Machine Learning Approach to Predict the Critical Temperature of a Superconductor contains the extensive research
